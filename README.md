# SubredditMonitor
This console app will scan a chosen subreddit's latest batch of posts for a chosen keyword. An email will be sent from a provided GMail account to a given email address (SMS can be sent if proper domain is used).

Pull down the project, open the sln, set the approproate values in gmailRecipient, gmail Username, gmailPw, and gmail Subject; set the subredditName you would like to monitor and the keyWord you'd like to scan for. It's set up for posts that have "deal" (case insensitive) in the title on the XboxOne subreddit by default.
